## Vector Embeddings

Vector embeddings are numerical represenatations of unstructured data, such as text, images or audios and even the videos in the form of vectors. These embeddings capture the semantic similarity of objects by mapping them to points in a vector space, where similar objects are represented by vectors that are close to each other.
